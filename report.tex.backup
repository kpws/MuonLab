\section{Introduction}

\section{Experimental setup}
In this experiment we used three plastic scintillator detectors located on top of each other. The upper two detectors, \emph{P1} and \emph{P2}, are flat. They are separated by a gap of 2.4 meters with P1 on the top. The lowest detector, \emph{B}, was bigger to be able to fully stop the muons. When a muon goes through one of the detectors we will get a light pulse that is amplified by a photo multiplier tube (PMT). The time difference between pulses from P1 and P2 can be used for determining the speed of the muons. These PMT signals were reshaped by a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) and then sent to a time to amplitude converter (TAC). The signal from P1 was used to start the TAC and the signal from P2 to stop it. See Figure \ref{setup}. A computer recorded the output of the TAC. The relationship of the channel recorded by the computer and the time delay measured by the TAC was determined by sending pulses of known delays to its start and stop inputs.\\  %ev bild av tCal
A radioactive $^{60}$Co sample was placed below P2 for calibration. It releases two photons simultaneously so that they can be detected in both P1 and P2. The pulses from P2 were delayed enough for both the muons going through P1 and then P2 and the photons going the opposite direction to be timed.
The difference of the delays of the signals from P1 and P2 to the start and stop of the TAC is not known to high enough precision. 

To determine the lifetime of the muons we used on scintillator and the barrel detector. Coincidence between the barrel and the scintillator were used to be able to identify signals from muons that went through the scintillator and then absorbed in the barrel. The barrel will first give a signal from the energy absorbed when slowing down the muon and another signal when it decays. The start and stop signals are separated by an AND respectively AND-NOT gate with the scintillator signal, see fig().
